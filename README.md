# Predicting future medical diagnoses with RNNs using Fast AI API from scratch
## *Full pytorch implementation Doctor AI paper using Electronic Health Records*

In the first [part one](https://github.com/sparalic/Electronic-Health-Records-GRUs) of this tutorial we created a rough template of the Doctor AI: Predicting Clinical Events via Recurrent Neural Networks paper(2016) by Edwared Choi et.al. In this tutorial we took it a step further using the Fast.ai buttoms up approach. This code is fully functional and details on how the data was processed can be accesed in [part one](https://github.com/sparalic/Electronic-Health-Records-GRUs).
